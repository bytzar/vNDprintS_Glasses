Always have the holes for the hinges point upwards. Enable supports for the ear thing. dont for the other thing. layer and first layer height 1mm. add a modifier cube with infill 100% for the hinger holder so when you solder down the screws it catches on the plastic. then screw it in.

I went stupid for 3 weeks sitting on this. like ball and chain making me a prisoner of my own home. I was victim of so many fallocies. i failed my driving test midway through which was fun. cheers
